		<!-- FIRST PROGRAMME -->
		<h6>1.Decadance By Batsheva Dance Company
			<p>Genre: Dance</p>
			<br>Created for the first time in 2000, this program celebrated Ohad Naharin's ten years of creation within the company by offering a striking collage of excerpts from his repertoire. Regularly  recomposed and enriched since, the piece is today the opportunity, for  the Israeli choreographer,
			<br>
			to show the variety of his inspiration - the  most demonstrative movement to the very intimate expression -, but also  to question the lines of force from his work. More than a set of selected pieces, it is therefore a real re-creation whose repertoire provides the material constantly revisited.
			<br>
			Energetic and sensual, always on the string of emotions, those of the body or those of the soul, the dance becomes its own theater. For the greatest pleasure of the spectator, carried away in a whirlwind of gestures, sounds and unforgettable images served by a troupe at its best.
			<br>Artistic direction: Ohad Naharin

			5.	Emily the Musical 2016

			<p>Genre: Theatre</p>

			Nonya matriarch Emily Gan has been a winner since she appeared thirty years ago in Stella Kon’s acclaimed play, “Emily of Emerald Hill”. The play has been loved by audiences in Singapore and Malaysia ever since. The play has been translated into French, Chinese, Japanese, Icelandic and Kannada, with per formances in France, China and India.
			<br>
			Now Emily’s story has been transformed into a musical, by Stella Kon herself, with songs by award-winning composer Desmond Moey. Instead of the solo actress of the play, we see the glittering Nonyas and Babas of the 1930’s. We hear them pour out their hearts in song, as music conveys their pains and passions, and the colourful Peranakan love of life.
			<br>
			This version is presented by Musical Theatre Ltd.
